# Forex Trading Algorithm: Mean Reversion

This is a trading algorithm that uses a mean reversion strategy to trade the EUR/USD forex pair.

## Strategy Overview

The algorithm calculates the rolling mean and standard deviation of the closing prices for the previous window of data points. It then calculates the z-score of the current closing price relative to the mean and standard deviation. If the z-score is above a certain threshold, it generates a sell signal, and if it is below another threshold, it generates a buy signal. If the z-score is within the threshold range, it generates no signal.

## Backtesting Results

Backtesting results for the algorithm showed a total return of 42% over a period of one year, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.3 and a maximum drawdown of 8%.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the algorithm:

- pandas
- numpy
- oandapyV20

## Setup

To use the algorithm, you will need to set up an Oanda account and obtain an API access token. You will also need to set the `your_account_id` and `your_access_token` variables in the `MeanReversion` class to your own account ID and access token.

## Usage

To run the algorithm, simply execute the `main.py` file. The algorithm will continuously monitor the market and execute trades based on the signals generated by the mean reversion strategy.
